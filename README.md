# DnDUtility
An Initiative tracker, Dice-roller, and Note-taker, originally designed for 4E

This was written and tested in Eclipse and is very incomplete. This was also my first ever Java project that I have been
going back and revising over time. It originally was only one file to do dice rolling, initiative tracking and notes. Now
it has separate files, proper classes, and still does basically the same thing. At the time of making this I had the goal of
parsing the XML-like file that the DND4e creator put out, and I still may do that, but I would like to make this a more versatile
tool. 

My primary focus right now is the initiative tracker, It is lacking right now and I'd like to be able to add more features.
One feature I am particularly excited to add is a monster selector/builder. I have a few .csv collections of monster information
that I may bundle into a proper database to package with the product.

Another goal for the initiative tracker is to properly handle taking and dealing damage. This is more for fun than it is for
usability, as I know people prefer to have real dice rolls and not digital, though the tool would help me greatly when running
an online game.
